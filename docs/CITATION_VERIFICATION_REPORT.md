# Citation Verification Report

Checked on 2026-10-22. Sources: the arXiv API (titles, full author lists, comments,
journal references, DOIs), the Semantic Scholar API (venue, year, pages, DOI), the
papers' own PDFs where opened, and publisher pages. Every entry in
`paper/references.bib` is listed. Status:

- **Verified**: title, authors and venue confirmed from a record listed in the row.
- **Verified, venue from author note**: venue confirmed only by the authors' own arXiv
  comment or PDF header.
- **Check**: one field could not be confirmed online; the row says which.

## Actions before submission

1. Confirm the six **Check** rows on the publisher or proceedings page and correct the bib if needed.
2. Rerun a related work search (arXiv, ACL Anthology, Google Scholar) for "self-consistent errors", "consistent hallucination", "pressure", "sycophancy" and "hallucination detection" to catch papers published after 2026-10-22.
3. Compile and check that every `\cite` resolves (`paper/validation_report.json`, `undefined_citations`).
